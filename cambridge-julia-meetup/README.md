# "You have data and I have distributions: a talk on `Turing.jl` and `Bijectors.jl`
This contains the files used in my presentation at the [2nd Julia meetup in Cambridge](https://www.meetup.com/London-Julia-User-Group/events/265586612/).

## Setup
The source of the presentation can be found in `presentation.org`, and the actual presentation is `presentation.html` which I've generated using the magnificent [ox-reveal.el](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal) package, resulting in a presentation viewable in the browser (using the Javascript [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
